I did make changes because my family doesn\u2019t care for spicy foods. Instead of using andouille sausage, I used a smoked chicken Italian sausage, I used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of the Cajun spice, and about a cup of Parmesan cheese instead of cream cheese. After I stirred in the Parmesan cheese, I topped it off with a handful of shredded mozzarella, put the cover back on until the mozzarella melted, and served. My husband and son both liked it a LOT!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2021-07-21","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"ChicagoKempers"},"reviewBody":"This meal had good flavor, but I found myself avoiding the sausage pieces because they were overcooked and rubbery. It might be worth trying this recipe using sliced fresh sausage (you can cut fresh sausages easier if you put them in the freezer for 20 minutes before slicing), but then you\u2019d probably want to start with searing the sausages first, removing them from the pan to cook the peppers and onions, then reintroducing them when you add the liquid ingredients. I imagine it would be delicious with shrimp or chicken as well. I will definitely try making this again, but I won\u2019t be using pre-cooked sausages.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":3,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2021-07-21","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"HelenPB"},"reviewBody":"This was delicious, and easy to make.

What a great idea to use orzo and cook it in with everything else. Love it and so do the kids! I am eating lower sodium, so I used a turkey kielbasa that is lower in salt and only added a tiny bit of himalayan salt in the recipe. My cajun seasoning is homemade and salt-free. This will be in the rotation! I love how fast it is, too. Might add in some shrimp next time.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}}],"recipeCategory":["dinner"],"recipeYield":"4 servings","description":"One-Pan Cajun Sausage & Orzo is an easy weeknight dinner with tons of comfort and flavor.
